Estab has many plates.


user may rate many plates
user may rate many estabs

user - estabratingconnection - estab
                             - rating details

user makes a rating for an establishment
user id and estab id stored in table
user rating for that estab stored in a different table.

rating table could have:

|rating id| user id| estab id| description| score|

but then this negates the connection - unless remove user and estab ids
and add the connecting id.


Simplest scenario is user rating a plate.

user rates plate =>
insert into plate rating user id, plate id, score, description
